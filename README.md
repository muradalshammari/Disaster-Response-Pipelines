# Disaster Response Pipeline

#### A project from my Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. A machine learning pipeline implemented through a web app that classifies tweets to assist with disaster emergency response

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/


### Files of importance:

   * `app/templates/*` templates/html files for web app
   * `data/process_data.py`Extract Train Load (ETL) pipeline used for data cleaning, feature extraction, and storing
   data in a SQLite database
   * `models/train_classifier.py` A machine learning pipeline that loads data, trains a model, and saves the trained
   model as a .pkl file for later use
   * `run.py` The file used to launch the Flask web app used to classify disaster messages
